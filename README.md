# swes

This is my personalised build system for building and developing Svelte 4 web applications, using ESBuild exclusively.

It supports a dev mode and a build mode, and is configurable using a config file.

The program has included help which shows you how to configure it further if required, just install this package and run it the CLI:

```
npm i --save-dev @benjamingwynn/swes
npx swes
```

This is designed around being used for Single Page Applications, such as [tetromino.app](https://tetromino.app) and is much faster than Vite, supports handling meta tag images, installing service workers, and more.
